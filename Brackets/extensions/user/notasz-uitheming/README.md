Brackets UI Theming Enable
===

A simple extension to allow native theme developers to include CSS code to style all available UI elements in Brackets. 
Brackets themes available via the extension registry cannot currently theme outside of the editor, but this extension solves that. Using this extension, any theme developer can include CSS code to style any UI element available in Brackets. If the user does not have this extension, the extra CSS code will be ignored and the Editor will still be themed as normal.

Notes
---
Please note that the Brackets developers have not included UI theming because it can, and probably will break as Brackets continues development. As such, UI themes are bound to break in future versions and it will be up to the theme developers to keep them up to date as time goes on.

To do List
---
- Add an option to enable/disable in the Theme modal.
